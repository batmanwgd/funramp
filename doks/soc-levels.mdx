## System and Organizational Control (SOC)



#### High-Level Review of SOC Concepts
_When we talk about SOC, we are normally talking about the reports that result from a SOC audit, so another way you could think of this topic area would be SOCR_

#### SOC Tiers Compared

SOC 1 and SOC 2 are the most common SOC reports, so understanding the difference between them is essential. The difference between SOC 1 and SOC 2 is that SOC 1 focuses on financial reporting, whereas SOC 2 focuses on compliance and operations.

SOC 3 reports are less common. SOC 3 is a variation on SOC 2 and contains the same information as SOC 2, but it’s presented for a general audience rather than an informed one. If a SOC 2 report is for auditors and stakeholders inside the company you’re selling to, SOC 3 is for that company’s customers.
